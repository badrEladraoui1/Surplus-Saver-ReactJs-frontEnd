        About Surplus Saver: Reducing Food Waste, One Meal at a Time
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Welcome to Surplus Saver, where our mission is to combat one of the
        world&apos;s most pressing challenges: food waste. Every year, billions
        of tons of perfectly good food end up in landfills while millions go
        hungry. Surplus Saver is our solution to this global problem.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        At Surplus Saver, we&apos;ve created a user-friendly online platform
        that connects restaurants with surplus food to consumers and
        organizations in need. Our goal is simple yet profound: to bridge the
        gap between surplus food and those who can benefit from it, thereby
        reducing food waste and alleviating hunger.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Through Surplus Saver, restaurants can easily list their surplus food
        items, providing details such as type, quantity, and expiration date.
        Meanwhile, consumers and organizations can browse these listings,
        finding delicious meals while contributing to a sustainable cause.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        But Surplus Saver is more than just a marketplace. It&apos;s a community
        dedicated to raising awareness about food waste and promoting
        sustainable practices. We provide educational resources, tips, and tools
        to help users minimize waste in their own lives and make environmentally
        conscious choices.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Join us in the fight against food waste. Together, we can make a
        differenceâ€”one meal at a time. Welcome to Surplus Saver, where every
        bite counts.
